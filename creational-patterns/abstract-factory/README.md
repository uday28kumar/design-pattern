# Abstract Factory Design Pattern
The **Abstract Factory Design** Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is used when the system needs to work with multiple related product families that are designed to be used together.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Abstract Factory:** Declares interfaces for creating abstract products.
- **Concrete Factory:** Implements the creation methods for specific product families.
- **Abstract Product:** Declares an interface for a type of product.
- **Concrete Product:** Implements the abstract product interface for specific variants.

**Structure:**
- **Client:** Interacts with the factory through the abstract interface.
- **Factory:** Creates product objects using the abstract factory interface.

**Benefits:**
- **Promotes encapsulation:** Hides the concrete classes from the client.
- **Ensures consistency:** Products created by a single factory are compatible.
- **Supports scalability:** Adding new product families requires minimal changes.

**Drawbacks:**
- Can increase complexity due to multiple classes/interfaces.
- Adding new products in an existing family requires updating all factory interfaces.

**This pattern is ideal for scenarios involving product families with variants. Let me know if you'd like more examples!**
