# Singleton Design Pattern
The **Singleton Design Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is often used to manage shared resources such as configurations, logging, or database connections.

**Key Features:**
- **Single Instance:** Only one object of the class is created.
- **Global Access Point:** The instance is accessible globally.
- **Thread-Safety:** The implementation can ensure thread safety in multi-threaded environments.

**Advantages:**
- Reduces memory usage by limiting instance creation.
- Provides a single point of control.

**Use Cases:**
- Configuration management.
- Logging services.
- Managing shared resources (e.g., connection pools).
