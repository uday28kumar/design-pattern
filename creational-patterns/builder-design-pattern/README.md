# Builder Design Pattern
The **Builder Design Pattern** is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step-by-step. It allows you to create different representations of an object using the same construction process, making it particularly useful for objects with many optional attributes.

**Key Components:**
- **Builder:** Defines the abstract interface for creating parts of a product.
- **Concrete Builder:** Implements the builder interface to create and assemble parts of the product.
- **Product:** The complex object being built.
- **Director (Optional):** Oversees the building process and ensures the steps are executed in a specific sequence.

**Example Use Case:**

- Creating a Car object with various optional features like a seat, GPS, and engine type.

**Advantages:**
- Allows for step-by-step construction of complex objects.
- Makes the object construction process more readable and flexible.
- Simplifies the creation of immutable objects.

**Disadvantages:**
- Can increase the complexity of the code due to the introduction of multiple classes.
- Requires more effort if the number of product variations is small.
