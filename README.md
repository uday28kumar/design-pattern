# Design Pattern
**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. It's a general concept for solving a particular problem.
## The Catalog of Design Patterns
There are mainly three groups of pattern.

**Creational patterns:** These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural patterns:** These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral patterns:** These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
